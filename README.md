# adblocker
An adblocker like AdAway but for Linux

# How does it work?
This adblocker binds a modified /etc/hosts file on /etc/hosts. It then runs a https server with an self signed certificate which effectively blocks ads. (Note: It's not detected by modern adblocker detectors)  
It uses the sources of AdAway.
